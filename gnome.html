    I want to tell you a story
    'Bout a little man, If I can
    A gnome named Grimble Grumble
    And little gnomes stay in their homes
    Eating, sleeping
    Drinking their wine


    He wore a scarlet tunic
    A blue-green hood, it looked quite good
    He had a big adventure
    Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
    Wining, dining
    Biding his time


    And then one day, hooray!
    Another way for gnomes to say
    Ooh, my
 
    Look at the sky, look at the river
    Isn’t it good?
    Look at the sky, look at the river
    Isn’t it good?
    Winding, finding
    Places to go
  

    And then one day, hooray!
    Another way for gnomes to say
    Ooh, my
    Ooh, my
            </pre>
